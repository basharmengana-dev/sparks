# Sparks

A fun react native project that uses react native skia (https://github.com/Shopify/react-native-skia) and react reanimated libraries (https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/) to create a fireworks effect in a list view. This hobby project was a way to learn both these libraries!
